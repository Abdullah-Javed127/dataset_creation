Hey, this is for my FYP(Final Year Project). Using Groq api, i've curated a dataset that's important for training a distilled-gpt2 model. 
To run this on your own:

-Change the prompt to your need.

-Put the Groq key in the .env file.

-Use any of the supported models (check Groq's website for that).

NOTE: If you are using the free tier models, there is a Token limit. I've bypassed that somewhat here.
